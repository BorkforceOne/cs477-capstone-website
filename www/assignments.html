                    <p>The key to effective teamwork is shared agreement on the expectations
                        of teammates concerning how the team will function. Standards may range
                        from assigning specific roles to each team member, to establishing protocols
                        for conduct and communication, to agreeing on what tools (version control,
                        word processor, etc.) the team will use. Team standards -- of all these
                        kinds -- establish a common understanding of expectations, and facilitate
                        efficient and effective collaboration. Without these norms teams have difficulty
                        communicating and cooperating since each individual may have a different
                        interpretation of how things should be done.
                        <br>Although we will have regular peer evaluations at the class level, generally
                        associated with major deliverables, it is also important for the team to
                        do its own internal "self reviews". Your Team Standards document should
                        capture how often these get done, and what form they take.

                    <h3></h3>
                    <p>The first task for a newly-formed team is to take an inventory of what
                        talents exist on the team...and what gaps there might be in the team's
                        capabilities that one should think about planning to fill. On a more personal
                        side, it's nice to get to know a little more the team members, including
                        some hobbies or special interests.This all has several purposes:&nbsp;
                        <br>For the client&nbsp;
                        <br>This packet of information will provide the&nbsp;client with a preliminary&nbsp;overview
                        of the team working on the project. This will allow the client to better
                        understand what the team's strengths and weaknesses are, and how he/she
                        can best support the team.&nbsp;
                        <br>For the team&nbsp;
                        <br>This provides the team with some knowledge of its collective strengths
                        and weaknesses. Clearly, this information will be instrumental in individual
                        task assignments, project selection, negotiating project specifications,
                        establishing design philosophy and strategy, project scheduling, and overall
                        project management.</p>

                    <h2>Mini-Intro: presentation</h2>
                    <h3></h3>
                    <p>This assignment assumes that you have done this preliminary requirements
                        analysis with your client in your first meetings, and asks you to summarize
                        it efficiently and professionally for the rest of the class. In this way,
                        we all have a chance to learn more about this year's projects, it provides
                        a first chance to hone your presentation skills, and it forces you to think
                        in a structured way about the project you are tackling.
                        <br>Each team will create a 5-7 minute summary presentation on their project.
                        The biggest challenge here is to keep it short and sweet, meaning just
                        enough explanation to get the project outlined clearly, no lengthy digressions,
                        but complete enough to cover all relevant aspects of the project. Creating
                        this sort of "elevator pitch" is a real skill (there are competitions for
                        it, see YouTube) and, while you likely won't be giving many of these in
                        an elevator, being able to describe/sell a concept very compactly is an
                        awesome skill to have.It's up to each team to decide how to tell their
                        story most effectively (it has to *flow* and engage us!)

                    <h2>Technological Feasibility</h2>
                    <h3></h3>
                    <p>It's easy to come up with the most imaginative and crazy designs: magically
                        updating distributed data stores, super fancy reactive graphical interfaces,
                        massive networks of maps or nodes that all layout automatically and perfectly.
                        We all know, however, that not all designs that you can imagine are feasible,
                        meaning that they can't be implemented within the given cross-section of
                        chosen platform, speed/usability goals, computational limitations, and
                        other factors that frame your particular project. For these reasons, it's
                        important to (a) develop a strong early grasp of the feasibility limitation
                        that could exist in your project; and (b) to keep these in mind continually
                        as you do requirements acquisition and early design. Too often we've had
                        Capstone teams that have extracted requirements and envisioned a fabulous
                        design that has them and their sponsor completed excited...only find out
                        later (too late!) that certain key elements of their design simply aren't
                        feasible. Developing an early understanding of what can and can't be done
                        is a key to producing a good and successful design!</p>
