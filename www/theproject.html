                        <p class="lead text-left">Coming to a foreign country is always a scary proposition, especially
                            as a young student perhaps away from home for the first time. The purpose
                            of the FlagFriends organization is to support this transition by connecting
                            incoming international students at NAU with local friends who can show
                            them the ropes, or even a family that can welcome them into American life.
                            It’s so much easier when you have someone who can call on to explain how
                            the banking system works, discuss how food shopping works and what choices
                            are available, and explain transportation options! The host persons or
                            family benefits as well, by getting to know and interesting person and
                            a new culture.
                            <br>
                            <br>&nbsp;The way that this process currently works is extremely inefficient,
                            unreliable, and manual effort intensive: Joy Knudsen must attend pre-semester
                            orientation sessions, interested students (hosts and incoming internationals)
                            must fill out paper application forms. Alternatively, this paper form can
                            be downloaded from the existing website for printing, filling in, and mailing
                            in. In any case, the process is arduous, forms are often incomplete or
                            illegible, and “matching” of host student interests is done manually by
                            Joy, with mixed results.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>The goal of this project is to&nbsp;streamline, enhance and improve this
                            basic process by several orders of magnitude. In particular, the aim is
                            to develop a sophisticated web-site that supports the entire existing process,
                            and also explores a number of value-added features made possible by this
                            new platform. Specific functionalities must include:&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>• An account-based mechanism to allow students and sponsors to sign up
                            for the service, in much the same way that most&nbsp;other webapps do this,
                            i.e., either provide a login/passwd, or choose to login via Google or Facebook.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>• Mechanisms to allow both potential sponsors and incoming international
                            students to enter their personal and contact details, i.e., an online&nbsp;application
                            form. Rather than mimicking the current paper form, it would be more like
                            a profile that you create on the system, much like with online dating sites.
                            The basic profile should be fast and easy to create, with additional options
                            to add photos, give more detailed information, etc. The team will work
                            with the sponsor to determine useful profile elements.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>• An efficient, elegant reactive interface to search,&nbsp;filter, or
                            browse (note that these are different functions!) the database to examine
                            potential matches. This should work for both students and hosts, but will
                            probably be used mostly by students looking what hosts might be available.
                            <br>
                            <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;• Allow both sponsors and students to express “preferences”,
                            i.e., constrain matches based on desirable attributes across the possible
                            categories. This feature is most likely to be used by hosts to express
                            their constraints/preferences with respect to things like smoking, nationality,
                            gender; but the feature might be useful for incoming students as well.
                            It should be possible to set notifications (e.g. by email) when a new record
                            matching the given preferences enters the system.
                            <br>
                            <br>&nbsp;• A commentary system that allows students to add their thanks and
                            (hopefully!) kind comments to the host’s profile, perhaps with a nice photo
                            of themselves. This is meant less as formal rating system and more as a
                            “guest book” feature that brings life into the system, and can serve to
                            introduce potential hosts to new incoming students via commentary left
                            by previous students.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>• A meta-model that allows organizations (like FlagFriends) to create
                            accounts and customized home pages in the system...and then open this new
                            site up to their local community&nbsp;for population with hosts/guests.
                            In this way, the site is not limited to supporting FlagFriends, but could
                            easily host any number of other similar organizations in cities across
                            the country and the world. It could also be used by any sort of “hosting”
                            scenario, e.g., it could be used to match refugees coming into a certain
                            area with suitable host families.&nbsp;
                            <br>
                            <br>• Must be implemented in a&nbsp;modern cloud-based, fully Web2.0 framework
                            and technology, to allow easy scalability and to support robustness. Absolute
                            emphasis must be placed on ease of maintenance of the system by a non-technical
                            client. The above features should be considered a minimal outline for what
                            the system has to do. Ultimately the team is expected to bring not only
                            strong technical expertise but also substantial creativity to this project,
                            to work with the client to refine the specification to create a truly useful
                            resource.</p>
